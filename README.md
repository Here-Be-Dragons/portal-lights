# portal-lights
Simple lighting effect for Arduino Pro Mini + WS2812B to replicate Portals from the popular Valve game
Hardware Needed:
- Portal-shaped mirrors (Ikea KOLJA mirrors work great)
- A method to hang the mirrors (I used a 2x4 piece of wood and a photo hanging kit wire)
- Enough WS2812B Individually-addressible LEDs
- A 5v Arduino of your choosing (I used the Arduino Pro Mini, no need for anything fancy here)
